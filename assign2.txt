You can continue with the same problem whatever you have done in Assignment -1. In addition, do the following.

 

1.      Refer to Qn B1 in Assignment 1

 

a)      Use static member function to check how many IC objects are created? Just cout whenever u create an IC. 

b)      Instead of set() function, use parameterized constructor IC(a,b) to set length=a and width=b.

c)      Also include a default constructor to set default width and height of IC as 1, 1. Can you do it with default arguments for both length and width? Any ambiguity issues you get?

d)      Use default destructor. Also you may define a scope block using delimiters {   } to check the validity of the objects outside the block.

 

 

2.      Refer to Qn A1 in Assignment 1

a)      Use constructor to initialize your stack.

b)      Modify resetStack() as follows. Have a static global buffer of some MAX size inside stack class.  Once a stack object S1 is full, a static function resetStack() must move the contents of s1 to the global buffer. On exit of the program, the destructor has to print the buffer contents.
